# Loan Default Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to build a classification model to predict whether a loan applicant will default using financial data from the Lending Club Loan Dataset. The model helps lenders identify high-risk applicants and reduce defaults.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Preprocess the Lending Club Loan Dataset.
- Handle missing values and class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.
- Train and evaluate classifiers (LightGBM and SVM).
- Generate a comprehensive performance report with recommendations for lenders.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Lending Club Loan Dataset**. It contains financial and demographic information about loan applicants, including features such as:
- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Employment length
- Annual income
- Loan status (target variable: default or non-default)

Download the dataset from [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) or use a publicly available version.

---

## Steps
1. **Preprocess the data**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert categorical variables to dummy variables.
   - Address class imbalance using SMOTE.
2. **Train classifiers**:
   - LightGBM
   - SVM
3. **Evaluate performance**:
   - Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
4. **Generate a performance report**:
   - Compare model performance.
   - Provide recommendations for lenders.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-default-prediction.git
   cd loan-default-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Place the Lending Club Loan Dataset in the project directory and name it `lending_club_loan_data.csv`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python loan_default_prediction.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Train and evaluate the models.
   - Generate a performance report in the console.

## Results
### Model Performance
| Model    | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| LightGBM | 0.93      | 0.93   | 0.93     |

           0       0.89      0.91      0.90      5000
           1       0.90      0.88      0.89      5000
    accuracy                           0.89     10000
   macro avg       0.89      0.89      0.89     10000
  weighted avg     0.89      0.89      0.89     10000
  ```

## Recommendations
1. Use the **LightGBM model** for better precision and recall.
2. Regularly update the model with new loan data to maintain accuracy.
3. Consider additional features like credit history and employment status for improved predictions.
4. Implement stricter lending criteria for high-risk applicants identified by the model.
